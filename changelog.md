# <cy>PRNTSCRN</c> Changelog
## v1.0.8
- Port to Geode v5.0.0-beta.1 and GD 2.2081.
- Added a new option to hide Noclip Tints from most major mod menus during screenshot.
  - This is to compensate for a few node IDs this mod claimed to filter, only to never actually do anything to them.
  - These options might also prove useful in a number of niche scenarios not worth discussing here.
- Added nodes from Difficulty Progression and MegaHack v9 to the "Hide UI" filter toggle.
  - These changes are not going away any time soon, and if anything, should've been added as early as v1.0.5.
- Added the dummy trail from Editor Trail In-Game to the "Hide Player" filter toggle.
  - The editor trail added by this mod is tied to the player.
- Automatically hide the grayscale shader from GrayscaleMode by default.
  - Originally, you had to hide the grayscale shader on your own if you were to take a screenshot inside a level.
## v1.0.7
- Fix some UI problems. Sorry about that!
